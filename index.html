                <h2><!-- <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> -->Overview</h2>
                <p>The GenAI x Gender Tech Hackathon, organized by Amrita University's School of Social and Behavioral Sciences in collaboration with the UNESCO Chair on Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment, is a groundbreaking initiative at the intersection of AI and social impact.</p>
                <p>In a world where AI is shaping our future, we are ensuring that future is equitable. By bringing together diverse minds, we are not just solving problems; we are redefining what's possible when technology meets social responsibility.</p>
                <p>This hackathon challenges participants to develop innovative AI-driven solutions addressing critical issues faced by women and marginalized communities. While we'll provide a curated wishlist of real-world problems at the start of the event, we also encourage you to think beyond these boundaries. To spark your creativity, here are some example project areas aligned with the GTC 2025 themes:</p>
                <ul class="project-ideas-list">
                    <li><strong>Government Scheme Bot:</strong> AI chatbots in local languages on WhatsApp/Telegram to help women access government schemes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Career Planner Bot:</strong> AI-based planner for girls to explore career paths based on their interests and abilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Public Speaking/Interview Coach:</strong> Tools to improve public speaking and interview skills among women and marginalized members of society using multimodal AI.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal Assistance using AI:</strong> AI-powered app which simplifies complex laws and enables low literacy users to perform Q&A on legal documents and prior cases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Women's Health Support:</strong> Multimodal, multi-lingual AI to provide maternal, child, and menstrual health advice and resources.</li>
                    <!-- <li><strong>AI-Powered Safety App:</strong> App that uses AI to enhance personal safety, including route suggestions, emergency alerts, and community support features.</li> -->
                </ul>
                <p>These are just starting points. At the hackathon, you will receive a curated wishlist of real-world challenges from our partners, but we also strongly encourage original ideas. Whether inspired by the wishlist, these examples, or your own experiences, your creativity has the power to unlock transformative solutions we haven't yet imagined. Think big and bold!</p>
                <p class="cta-text">Are you ready to harness the power of AI for social good? Join us in this exciting journey to create a more inclusive, equitable digital future. Your idea could be the one that changes lives!</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Absolutely! We encourage you to think creatively about how generative AI can be integrated into diverse interfaces. Consider exploring VR/AR, games, IoT devices, smart toys, wearables, voice assistants, or gesture-based interfaces. The goal is to leverage AI in innovative ways to address gender-related challenges.</p>
